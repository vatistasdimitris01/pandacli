# pandacli VS Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that integrates [pandacli](https://github.com/vatistasdimitris01/pandacli) directly into your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

This extension requires the [pandacli CLI](https://github.com/vatistasdimitris01/pandacli) to be installed on your system. Visit the [pandacli repository](https://github.com/vatistasdimitris01/pandacli) for installation instructions.

## Features

- **Quick Launch**: Use `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to open pandacli in a split terminal view, or focus an existing terminal session if one is already running.
- **New Session**: Use `Cmd+Shift+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to start a new pandacli terminal session, even if one is already open. You can also click the pandacli button in the UI.
- **Context Awareness**: Automatically share your current selection or tab with pandacli.
- **File Reference Shortcuts**: Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references. For example, `@File#L37-42`.

## Support

This is an early release. If you encounter issues or have feedback, please create an issue at https://github.com/vatistasdimitris01/pandacli/issues.

## Development
